#Club Finder Group Project showcasing the skills learned in CS3443

This is a java application designed to cover all of the clubs and organizations at the Univeristy of Texas at San Antonio as well as organize the data. The motivation for choosing this idea was the desire to join multiple clubs on campus, but not having a clear organized list by which to choose from. Upon opening the application, the user is asked to log in in a specific format then prompted to choose what school they are attending. After this, a table is presented with all of the clubs at UTSA. There are also various buttons used to sort the data to find specifc types of clubs.

The main challenges faced during the project were tring to figure out how best to display the data. We finally decided on TableView, which has different cells for each of the pieces of information. Additionally, using the table allows users to click on an element and have that elements info be displayed on screen.

This project was made using java, as well as javaFX for the GUI components.

To run this project, the eclipse IDE is required, as well as the java JRE 1.8_251, the java JDK 8, and javafx.
